### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Add screenshots (optional but recommended)

- Create a folder called `assets` in your project folder.
- Save screenshots inside it with names matching your Markdown links, e.g., `main_window.png` and `encryption_progress.png`.
- The images will now appear correctly in GitHub.

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Preview it on GitHub

Once you push your project to GitHub, GitHub will automatically render `README.md` in a **clean, formatted style**.

---

If you want, I can **create a ready-to-push folder structure with README, .gitignore, requirements.txt, and a placeholder assets folder** so you can just push it directly to GitHub.

Do you want me to do that?
